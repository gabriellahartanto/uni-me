# uni-me

## A dynamic, uni plan platform!

Start by selecting the commencing term and total years of study, then click 'Continue'.
Yes, it might not budge but, don't click twice! 

Awesome! Next up, add in the data for your specific courses, according to your university degree handbook. You can add in as much as you like.
If you're done adding in, go ahead and press 'Done' and click 'See' to see your fantastically made schedule.

And, if you missed a course, just press 'Add' and you can add more of workload on your backs.

Note: this is still a beta verson :)

Thanks!
